    <p>Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text.<br> It has roots in a piece of classical Latin literature from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years old.<br> Richard McClintock, a Latin professor at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, looked up one of the more obscure Latin words, consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage, and going through the cites of the word in classical literature, discovered the undoubtable source.<br> Lorem Ipsum comes from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" (The Extremes of Good and Evil) by Cicero, written in 45 BC. </p>
